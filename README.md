# PST Habibi

This project is a school project I created during my 2nd year at the [ESIEA](https://www.esiea.fr). 
'Habibi' is the name of this game, created using [Unity 2020.3.30f1](https://unity3d.com/fr/unity/whats-new/2020.3.30).
It's a platformer-type game, with a little story and a boss battle at the end.
